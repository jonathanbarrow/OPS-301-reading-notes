Today's reading involved the gender gap in the tech industry and connected it to video game markeitng in the 1990s. Video games were constatly marketed as for boys and as such, computers and related devices were always seen as for 'boys'. This lead to the the gender gap that is seen in the industry today. 
Even the term game boy was a contributing factor that the artcile mentioned. 

I think that if the tech field is to be even better they should include all sorts of people from all kinds of backgrounds. This would make the organizations stronger by allowing the best of the best candidates to contribute to the organzations success. This would be in contrast to pooling from one select candidate pool.
