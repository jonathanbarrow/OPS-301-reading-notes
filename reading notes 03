Reading: Today’s reading covered the concept of endpoint agents and their continued use in today’s virtual and on-prem networks. With the rise of working from home and devices connecting to a network off premises, gives rise to a number of potential security risks and concerns. Endpoint agents are monitoring software that can implement a variety of security protocols and procedures to enhance a network's security and prevent certain endpoints from being compromised. This software must be installed on an endpoint, a device in the last level of a network, and gather intelligence on the device's usage, security, and vulnerability. Endpoint agents are also extremely useful in gathering data and converting capabilities to the cloud. 
The reading also covered OS hardening. Hardening is the process of improving a device's security through the process of least privilege. Least privilege is the concept of programming a computer to only do what you normally do and nothing else. This can be beneficial to a network's security as any abnormal procedures from least privilege devices are quickly seen.
